# blazor-link-in-bio-page-builder
A "link in bio" page builder on .NET and Blazor

Targeting .NET 9.0

This is meant for me to start building a mental model of the Blazor Server hosting model. I have a lot of experience with Razor pages, but I need to begin utilizing Blazor where it is appropriate to the task.
